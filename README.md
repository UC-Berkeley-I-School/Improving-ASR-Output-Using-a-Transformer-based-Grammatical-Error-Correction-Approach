## Abstract
In this work, we introduce a transformer-based encoder-only grammatical error correction approach for improving automatic speech recognition by utilizing both a grammatical acceptability classifier (GAC) and a grammatical error correction model (GEC). We investigate different strategies for optimizing the models and show that using raw data to train our GAC model generates better outputs than using cleaned and augmented data. We also find that the model which punctuates and proper-cases the input data by means of Named Entity Recognition (NER) yields better results than other GEC models, leading to reduced over-correction. Considering phonetics also improved model performance, and the performance differs between gender and emotions.
